        Project Feasibility
    </h2>
    <p>Feasibility is a part of 'Iteration 0'.  It is a analysis that determines if the project that is to be undertaken is a good idea for the company.
    Organizational feasibility determines whether our company can undertake a certain project.  For example, a new tablet is something that could be considered
    feasibile at a organizational level for Apple.  A dating service would not be feasible at an organizational level.  Economic feasibility measures if it makes fiscal sense to follow through on the project.  Technical feasibility represents the ability of our technical staff to undertake the 
    specified project.</p>
